  <h2> What is a 3-D Animator?</h2>
  <p>In order to give a character the right personality traits and movements, the Animator needs to make sure that whoever is rigging the model does it with those things in mind. 
  Animators are responsible for giving objects weight and timing that result in the object feeling like it truly exists in the world we see it in. 
  Research about the assignment comes first, but then the artist decides what techniques to use and starts blocking out the main poses of the object they're working on. 
  The animator decides on the main poses which will include the starting pose, ending pose, and some poses in between. 
  Once these poses are in place, the artist gets feedback from a supervisor and moves forward with perfecting the movements of their model.</p>

  <h2> The Advantages of 3-D Animation</h2>
  <p>There are many advantages 3D animation has over traditional animation techniques. 
   Objects in a three-dimensional space can be more accurately represented than those in two dimensions.
  It enables animators to create environments, characters, and objects that appear more realistic than 2D animation.
  The use of three-dimensional models also makes it possible to create images that would be impossible or extremely difficult to generate with traditional animation techniques.</p>
